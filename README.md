# Rack Planner

Type a box size, get the number that fits in a rack, and see how they go in.
The default rack is 240 × 120 × 85 cm (L × W × H).

## What it works out

Given a rack and a box, it searches for the arrangement that holds the most
boxes. It does that by filling a solid grid of boxes in one orientation, then
cutting the leftover space three different ways and solving each piece the
same way, trying every orientation at each step. Mixing orientations is often
worth a lot: a 40 × 30 × 25 carton in the standard rack holds **78** boxes
mixed, against 72 if every box stands the same way up.

Three rules are available:

| Rule | What it allows |
| --- | --- |
| Any way up | All six rotations. Highest count. |
| Upright only | Height stays height; the footprint may turn. For "this side up" cartons. |
| Exactly as typed | No rotation at all. |

Alongside the count it reports how much of the rack's volume is used, how many
boxes stand on the shelf itself, how high the stack reaches, and — if you say
how many boxes you have — how many racks that needs.

## The two views

- **3D** — the rack with every box in place, coloured by orientation. Drag to
  turn it, scroll to zoom, shift-drag to slide. The slider fills the rack from
  the bottom up, so you can watch it build.
- **Plan** — the rack from above, cut through at the slider's height. This is
  the drawing to hand to somebody on the floor.

## Running it

There is no build step -- it is a folder of files and any static web server
will do. On the machine that hosts it, `serve.py` is that server:

```bash
python serve.py
```

Then open <http://localhost:8794>.

### Keeping it running on one PC

On OLT-0285 it starts by itself. Two shortcuts do it:

| Shortcut | Where it lives | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Rack Planner server` | the Startup folder | Runs `pythonw serve.py` at sign-in -- no window, no terminal. |
| `Rack Planner` | the Desktop | Runs `open-rack-planner.vbs`: opens the app, first starting the server if nothing is serving. |

`serve.py` listens on every address, so other machines on the office network
reach it too:

- <http://OLT-0285:8794> -- the host name, which does not change
- <http://10.2.11.31:8794> -- the address today, which DHCP may change

Nothing is published to the internet; this only works for people already on
the same network. Windows Firewall already allows this `pythonw.exe` inbound
on the Public profile. If the network is ever reclassified Private or Domain,
that allowance will need repeating for the new profile.

Note that `serve.py` throws its request log away. Under `pythonw.exe` there
is no console, so there is no `sys.stderr` for the usual logging to write to,
and the attempt would break the request halfway through.

## Saved racks and box sizes

Out of the box the two lists live in the browser, which is enough for one
person. To share them, create the tables and point the app at the project:

1. Run [`sql/schema.sql`](sql/schema.sql) in the Supabase SQL editor.
2. Put that project's URL and **publishable** key into `config.js`.

The app notices by itself — the line under the title says which of the two it
is using. Note that the tables are reachable with the publishable key by
anyone who can open the page; `sql/schema.sql` explains the trade and what to
change if the app ever gains a login.

## The files

| File | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `packer.js` | The search. No DOM, no dependencies — it can be tested on its own. |
| `view3d.js` | The 3D rack, on three.js. One instanced cube per box. |
| `view2d.js` | The plan view, on a plain 2D canvas. |
| `db.js` | The two lists, through Supabase or through this browser. |
| `app.js` | The wiring between the form, the numbers and the views. |
| `config.js` | Where Supabase goes, if you use it. |
